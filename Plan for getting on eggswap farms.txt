I made a pair using RARE and a shitcoin(it will technicaly be over 5k worth of RARE + shitcoin) the shitcoin is backed by bamboo in a mincraft server no one plays on.
The pair is here https://info.eggs.cool/pair/0x7ca17ae7e9c56e4dd83c39fa7cb612fdefac60c9, and if we can get RARE to 1 dollar, said pair will be over 5k, thus allowing Scarcity
(the group that runs RARE) To do buybacks, and make RARE/WEXP go over 5k, so RARE will be farmable.
